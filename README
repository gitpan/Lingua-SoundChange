Lingua/SoundChange version 0.01
===============================

This module was inspired by Mark Rosenfelder's sound change applier
program (http://www.zompist.com/sounds.htm). It's a tool for applying
sound changes to words -- for example, to show how words changed from
a parent language to a daughter language.

See also the eg/ subdirectory in the distribution for a script which
emulates Mark's sounds program.
