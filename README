Lingua/SoundChange version 0.03
===============================

This module was inspired by Mark Rosenfelder's sound change applier
program (http://www.zompist.com/sounds.htm). It's a tool for applying
sound changes to words -- for example, to show how words changed from
a parent language to a daughter language.

DIFFERENCES FROM THE LAST VERSION

Version 0.03 adds multiple-letter variable names. You can now use variable
names such as "cons" or "+vcd" rather than "C" or "V".

For changes from previous versions, see the file Changes.
