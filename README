Lingua/SoundChange version 0.05
===============================

This module was inspired by Mark Rosenfelder's sound change applier
program (http://www.zompist.com/sounds.htm). It's a tool for applying
sound changes to words -- for example, to show how words changed from
a parent language to a daughter language.

DIFFERENCES FROM THE LAST VERSION

Only minor differences between 0.04 and 0.05 (one of them is that $`
is no longer used).

Note that the interface has changed between version 0.03 and 0.04.

Previously, if you had a word 'oldword' that got changed to another word
'newword', then the return list of ->change would have an element with
'newword' in it. Or, if the 'keep' option was specified, then the return
list of ->change would have [ 'oldword', 'newword' ]. Furthermore, if the
'printRules' option was on, then rules would be printed to STDOUT during
the changing of the word.

These feature have now been rolled into one. Instead of the return list
of ->change consisting either of one new word per original word, or of
arrayrefs, it now consists of hashrefs. The keys currently in this hash
are:

* orig = the original word ('oldword' in the above example)
* word = the changed word ('newword' in the above example)
* rules = an arrayref containing the strings that would previously have
  been printed to STDOUT (they each end in a newline).

This means, among other things, that:

* the 'keep' and 'printRules' options have gone away (in effect, they are
  now always on)
* if you previously used the 'printRules' option, you will now have to
  print the rules message manually by iterating over @{ $elem->{rules} },
  where $elem is an element of the return list of ->change
* if you previously used, for example, $out->[0] (or $out->[0][1] with the
  'keep' option) to access the changed word, you will now have to use
  $out->[0]{word} instead.
